## PropRagdollConverter (For CS:GO Post-Operation-Riptide)
- This is an experimental implementation.
- The goal is to fix some of the client crashes that have been reported recently, which is related to ragdolls.
- This plugin replaces all cs_ragdoll with server-side prop_ragdoll, and also forces damageForce to zero-vector.
